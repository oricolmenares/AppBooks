# AppBooks
App created with HTML, SASS, Js(using jquery) and NODE.js With the API of GoogleBooks. I used 3 html files , 3 javascripts files and one for the routes. In this app you can search books using a keyword, from a tittle or  author. 
Then you can click on the book you prefeer and it will you show you some short description and more details.
The app only show 10 books.
